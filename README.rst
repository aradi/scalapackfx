SCALAPACKFX - Modern Fortran Interface for SCALAPACK, PBLAS and BLACS
=====================================================================

The open source library `SCALAPACKFX
<https://github.com/dftbplus/scalapackfx>`_ is an effort to provide modern
Fortran (Fortran 2003) wrappers around routines of the SCALAPACK, PBLAS and
BLACS libraries to make their use as simple as possible.

A few essential routines (especially those related to diagonalization) are
already covered. If not, you are cordially invited to extend SCALAPACKFX and to
share it in order to let others profit from your work. SCALAPACKFX is licensed
under the **simplified BSD license**.

Information about installation and usage of the library you find in the
documentation in the source, using both doxygen and sphinx. Project status,
current source code, bugtracker etc. can be found on the `SCALAPACKFX project
home page <https://github.com/dftbplus/scalapackfx>`_.
